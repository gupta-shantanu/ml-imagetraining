# ml-imagetraining
Testing and analyzing gradient descent algorithm by training a 400X400 neural net to invert a 20px image.

## Image Inversion
To test gradient descent convergence, neural net was trained with randomized dataset.
Trivial task of inverting an image was used to train the multivariate network. Convergence was recorded in a GIF animation.
